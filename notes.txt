List comprehension:
creating new list from prev list
primitively we loop thru to add or perform any operation on the list but in python we can do that in just one step
basically wht i learned in py ob, making loop code in one line

new = [n+1 for n in list]

conditional list comprehension
adding condition after the for operation

List comprehension in dictionary
new_dict = {new_key:new_value for (key,value) in dict.item() if test}

using this in panda dataframe
